 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.250   TIME= 13:53:24
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 15 (used by element 2960) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.000   TIME= 13:53:25
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UX   
 degree of freedom of node 1209) which may indicate a numerically        
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.

 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UZ   
 degree of freedom of node 1209) which may indicate a numerically        
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.
